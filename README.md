# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is one of the most well-known benchmarks for image classification tasks, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the goal is to predict the correct digit from 0 to 9.

The project walks you through loading and preprocessing the dataset, building a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Visualization of the results and predictions are included to help you understand how well the model performs.

## Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates:

- Data loading and preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify digits.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Visualization of sample predictions.

The project does not require any external datasets since the MNIST data is automatically downloaded when the code is run.

Make sure you have the following installed before running the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
   - tensorflow
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
     
You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
```
